![](doc/img/rm/rm_03.png)

This system consists of three main components that work together to simulate a full-fledged backdoor attack scenario:

- **Backdoor Trojan Program**: This malicious program runs on the victim’s machine, opening a backdoor that allows an attacker to remotely execute commands, steal credential files, perform harmful actions on the host computer, or inject other malware without authorization. The trojan remains hidden until activated by the hacker, making it difficult for security systems to detect it initially.

- **P2P Trojan Connector**: This is a console-based peer-to-peer remote control tool used by attackers to interact with the backdoor trojan. It enables hackers to execute destructive actions such as renaming files or filling the user's home directory with garbage files. The P2P connector supports multiple hackers controlling the same trojan simultaneously, creating a collaborative attack scenario.

- **Trojan Controller Hub**: This is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based control center, allowing attackers to manage multiple backdoor trojans on different victim machines. It provides batch control functionality, enabling hackers to launch coordinated attacks, such as wiping out all files in the home directories of every compromised machine. One hacker can control multiple trojans through this centralized hub.

#### Malware Protection Watchdog Program

The **Malware Watchdog Program** is designed to provide robust protection for malware or attack programs during cyber exercises, particularly for red team operations. One of the common challenges faced by attackers in these exercises is the ability of the blue team to swiftly stop malicious processes or delete files, rendering the attack ineffective. This project aims to counter those defensive measures by creating a watchdog that continuously monitors and ensures the uninterrupted operation of target programs. The system work flow diagram is shown below:

![](doc/img/rm/rm_06.png)

Key features of the Malware Watchdog Program include:

- **Continuous Monitoring**: The watchdog binds to the target program, vigilantly tracking its execution state in real time. This ensures that the program remains active and functional throughout the attack.
- **Dynamic Response Mechanism**: If the target program is terminated or its process is killed, the watchdog automatically launches a new instance of the program, ensuring that the attack can resume without manual intervention.
- **File Integrity and Recovery**: In cases where the target program file is deleted, the watchdog quickly detects the issue and restores the program from a backup, ensuring minimal downtime and continued operation.

This program is particularly useful for **Red Teaming in Cyber Exercises**, **Service Program Protection**, and **Malware Action Detection Research**. By binding the watchdog to a single program or chaining multiple programs together, users can create a self-protecting ecosystem where the programs automatically protect each other from being terminated or deleted.
